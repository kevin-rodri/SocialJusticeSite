    <h2>About My Topic</h2>
    <p>Many people spend many hours on social media platforms. The media consume them; they see and want to be updated. It's also possible that someone wants to keep in touch with someone through social media. Interactions may either be good or not, but regardless are consuming the attention of users.</p>
    <p>Technology is becoming a necessity in today's world; from texts to homework assignments to being informed of what's happening within the community, our demand for technological resources is rising. While the rise of technological resources can be found to be helpful, some risks come along the way. According to statistics, 59% of the world's population uses social media. The average daily usage is 2 hours and 29 minutes. While more than half of the world's population uses social media, their overall usage is more than the recommended time one should spend on a screen (If you're wondering how much time you should spend on a screen, check the link <a href = "https://www.reidhealth.org/blog/screen-time-for-adults" target="_blank">here</a>). The more time one spends on technology can lead to Insomnia, Eye Strain, and Reduced activity levels (there's more, but for the sake of this project, I will solely focus on three).</p>
