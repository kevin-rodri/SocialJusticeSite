    <p>Many people spend many hours on social media platforms. The media consume them; they see and want to be updated. It's also possible that someone wants to keep in touch with someone through social media. Interactions may either be good or not, but regardless are consuming the attention of users.</p>
    <p>Technology is becoming a necessity in today's world; from texts to homework assignments to being informed of what's happening within the community, our demand for technological resources is rising. While the rise of technological resources can be found to be helpful, some risks come along the way. According to statistics, 59% of the world's population uses social media. The average daily usage is 2 hours and 29 minutes. While more than half of the world's population uses social media, their overall usage is more than the recommended time one should spend on a screen (If you're wondering how much time you should spend on a screen, check the link <a href = "https://www.reidhealth.org/blog/screen-time-for-adults" target="_blank">here</a>). The more time one spends on technology can lead to Insomnia, Eye Strain, and poor mental health(there's more, but for the sake of this project, I will solely focus on three).</p>

    <h2 class = "center-title">Data About Overconsumption of Social Media </h2>
<div id = "Data" class = "problems">
  <div class="column">
    <h3>Problem #1: Insomnia</h3>
    <p class = "info">Because users are attached to a screen, more are people are reporting signs of Insomnia. Insomnia is a sleep disorder that affects the ability to fail to sleep. More than 3 millions of Americans have been diagnosed with insomnia, and around a quarter of the people that have been diagnosed with it is due to spending endless hours on social media. On average, health experts suggest that one gets 7-8 hours of sleep, but this number can vary from one person to another. Insomnia leads to lack of energy, unmotivated, and other daily activties.</p>

  <div class="column">
    <h3>Problem #2: Eye Strain</h3>
    <p class = "info">According to medical experts,on average, one should spend at least two hours on a screen.According to statistics, many young teens are averaging 9 hours a day while young adults are averaging over 11 hours of screen. This leads to eyes being dry and buring eye muscles that enable the eye to focus. Buring eye muscles can lead to permanant eye damage, which is why it's importatnt to not be consumed by what various technological platforms are doing, such as Snapchat, Tik Tok, and Instagram.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <h3>Problem #3: Poor Mental Health</h3>
    <p class = "info">Jeff Cain, a professor at the University of Kentucky, discusses the importance of how social platforms affect mental health. Cain examines factors that lead to addiction that eventually lead to poor mental health habits. The students that reported feeling hopeless also reported signs of being addicted to a device, which led to high feelings of stress and anxiety. Factors such as current, family, and economic issues were considered and played a part in how the students felt. Social media can be helpful, but certain groups use it to target those that are vulnerable, which can affect their emotional state.
